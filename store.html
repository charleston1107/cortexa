        <h2>CORTEXA Store</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to CORTEXA Store, the largest private hospital in Neuhumane City 
            that only specialize in caring, treating, and repairing your livputer. <br>
            <br>
            As CORTEXA gradually becomes more and more engaged in human’s lives, we are working 
            to make the presence of this new organ as comfortable and convenient for our customers 
            as possible. As an organ that stores data for the brain implants, livputer is easy to 
            accumulate toxins inside and develop tissues similar to tumors as it feeds on the substance 
            acquired from the liver. Highly concerned about people’s livputer wellbeing, we provide 
            all kinds of medical services regarding livputers, from inspections, health consulting, 
            cleaning operations, to data management advising. <br> <br>
            Livputer Healthcare was founded by computer engineer Compier Prankerd and surgeon Seybert Fraudling 
            back in 2124, when Livputer was still underdeveloped. Our experts team committed themselves to the 
            research of providing the best livputer care with the most affordable price.

                At Livputer Healthcare, our mission is to safeguard the health of 
                the livputer—an essential organ at the intersection of biology and data. 
                As livputers become deeply embedded in everyday life, we are committed to 
                ensuring that this integration remains safe, sustainable, and humane.<br>
                <br>
                We strive to make livputer care accessible, transparent, and reliable by 
                combining advanced medical practice with cutting-edge computational research. 
                From early inspections to long-term maintenance, our goal is to prevent datoxin 
                accumulation, identify abnormal tissue growth, and support the stable coexistence 
                of digital data and the human body.<br>
                <br>
                Founded on collaboration between engineering and medicine, Livputer Healthcare 
                is dedicated to continuous research, ethical care, and affordable treatment—so 
                that every individual can live, think, and remember with confidence in their 
                livputer’s wellbeing.
